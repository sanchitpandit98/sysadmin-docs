## Basic Checks

- **Give it time:** Sometimes programs can cause temporary freezes. Wait a few minutes to see if the laptop recovers on its own.  
- **Check the peripherals:** Make sure your mouse and external hard drives are functioning properly. Unplug any unnecessary peripherals.

## Force Close Unresponsive Programs

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+Del** simultaneously. This opens the **Task Manager**.  
2. Click the **Processes** tab.  
3. Identify the program that's not responding (it might show high CPU or memory usage).  
4. Click on the program name and select **End Task**.

## Restart the Laptop

- If the laptop is completely frozen, you might need to perform a **hard reset**.  
  Hold down the **power button** for 10â€“15 seconds until the laptop shuts down completely.  
- Wait for at least **30 seconds** before powering it back on.

## Additional Tips

- **Keep your software updated:** Outdated software can sometimes cause conflicts. Update your operating system and applications regularly.  
- **Scan for malware:** Malware infections can also disrupt your system. Run a scan with your antivirus software.  
- **Monitor your system resources:** Check your CPU, memory, and disk usage. High usage can lead to slowdowns and freezes. Close unnecessary programs or free up disk space if needed.  
- **Consider overheating:** If your laptop feels hot, it might be overheating. Ensure proper ventilation and clean dust buildup from vents.

## Create a Support Ticket

If the troubleshooting steps don't resolve the issue, you can create a support ticket with our IT Helpdesk. A support ticket allows us to track your issue and provide you with the most efficient solution.

### How to Create a Ticket:
1. **Locate the Helpdesk portal:** Your organization might have a dedicated online portal for submitting support tickets. Look for it on your company intranet or ask your IT department for the link.  
2. **Provide clear details:** In the ticket description, mention the problem you're facing, the troubleshooting steps you've tried, and any error messages you encountered.  
3. **Attach relevant files:** If applicable, include screenshots, error logs, or any other files that might help diagnose the problem.  
4. **Submit the ticket:** Once you've filled out the required information, submit the ticket. An IT support representative will be assigned to your case and will contact you to assist further.
