# How to Clean Your Laptop

## What You Need Before You Clean Your Laptop

Before you start cleaning your laptop, gather the following items:

- **Lint-free cloth:** A microfiber cloth works best.  
- **70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol:** This evaporates almost instantly and minimizes the risk of damaging the laptop's internals when cleaning the ports or keyboard.  
- **Air duster:** You can use a generic can of compressed air, but a cordless electric air duster with different bristles is better. Itâ€™s gentler than compressed air cans and lasts longer.  
- **Power off your laptop:** Always turn off your laptop and remove the power cord before cleaning.

## How to Clean Dell, HP, or Other Windows Laptops

The cleaning process is similar for most Windows laptops. Companies like Dell and HP recommend the following:

1. Use a mixture of **70% isopropyl alcohol** and a **microfiber cloth** that is damp (not dripping wet).  
2. Spray the alcohol solution onto the cloth, **not** directly on the laptop.  
3. Wipe the **exterior**, **screen**, and **keyboard** using the damp cloth.  
4. Because isopropyl alcohol dries quickly, it won't harm internal components.
