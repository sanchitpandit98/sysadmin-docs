# How to Change Your Password on a Domain-Joined Computer

## Ctrl+Alt+Del (Connected and Unlocked)

If you're up and running on the domain network, this method is the swiftest:

1. Press the magic key combination: **Ctrl+Alt+Del**.  
2. Select **"Change password"** from the menu that appears.  
3. Enter your current username and password. This verifies your identity to the domain controller.  
4. Craft a new password worthy of Fort Knox. Make sure it adheres to your domain's complexity requirements, which often include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  
5. Type your new password again for confirmation. Double-checking ensures you didn't mistype anything.  
6. Click **"Change password"** or a similar button. Congratulations, your password is updated!

## Remember These Password Pointers

- **Complexity is Key:** Most domains have minimum password complexity requirements. Ensure your password is a strong mix of character types to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Sharing is Not Caring:** Never share your password with anyone, not even IT support. They can reset your password if needed, but they shouldn't ask for your current one.  
- **Temporary Passwords:** If IT resets your password, you might be given a temporary one for initial login. You'll then be prompted to change it to a permanent password that meets the complexity requirements.
